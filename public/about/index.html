      <div class="indent halfmedia left">
        <p>This website was made for the NFTE 2019 Challenge. It's purpose is to bring awareness and preparedness into the community by giving people an easy way to learn to survive in disasters. The main page is styled to show many quick boxes that can be flipped for a simple summary. If the user wants to learn more, they can click the link and have a more in-depth reading to prepare and survive the storm. This website is also styled to read well on mobile devices, making it very accessible and even supports dark mode, when there might be a lack of power. Of course, a main issue with using a website is that if the internet goes down, users will not be able to access this website unless they download it onto their phone.</p>
        <p>Along with tips for survival, this website also includes a page for scouts and other people to learn the Emergency Preparedness merit badge. It will guide scouts by and help them complete their merit badge.</p>
