        <h2>Sandstorms</h2>
        <p>Dust and sandstorms are very unpredictable and dangerous. High winds lift dirt and sand particles into the air, unleashing a strong, suffocating cloud that can reduce visibility to almost nothing in a matter of seconds and cause property damage, injuries, and even death. It's a good idea to know what to do if you see a wall of sand racing toward you.</p>
        <h3>On foot</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><p><b>Put a mask over your face.</b> If you have a mask or respirator, put it on immediately. If you don't have a mask, use anything else: towels, cloths, a shirt. If you can, try to moisten it to keep your nose from drying up.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Protect your eyes.</b> Put on glasses or goggles to keep dust from blinding your view. If you don't have goggles, use your arm to shield your face as you move. Wrapping a cloth around your head and ears is also advised.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Look for shelter.</b> Anything that shileds you from the wind and the storm will do. Enclosures and buildings are the best options, and cars can offer protection too. Just be sure that the car is also in a safe location.</p></li>
          <ul>
            <li>When in shelter, protect as much of your skin as you can, as sand and dust will bounce around after hitting things.</li>
            <li>If you cannot find shelter, stick to the ground and crouch. This should decrease your size and make it less likely something big will hit you.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><p><b>Get to high ground.</b> </p></li>
        </ol>
