        <p>Sometimes, typos and broken links, such as the one you used to get here, actually lead to malicious websites. Websites also can copy the styling of a real website to seem correct and steal your credentials! In order to prorect yourself from evildoers, try practicing these checks when using the internet:</p>
        <h2>1. Is the website secure?</h2>
        <p>Many websites that are not trustable are often not secured. If the website asks for information, such as passwords, your age, etc., check to see if there is a green lock in your browser's url bar.</p>
        <p>Of course, even if the website is secured or not secured, that doesn't mean that the website is trustable or not. All this really means, is that if the website is secured, people on your network cannot see your information being transmitted from you to the server. The evildoers who own the server can still see your information.</p>
        <h2>2. Does the URL look fishy?</h2>
        <p>Malicious websites are often hosted at strange urls, that may look like "aafe815.face.biok.com" These urls might try to disguise as real websites, or sometimes just be completely random. Some other indicators that raise red flags are multiple redirects. If you notice that in order to get to the page, the website redirects through multiple different domains, it is likely spam or a site trying to steal your information.</p>
        <h2>3. Spelling and small issues</h2>
        <p>Believe it or not, malicious websites often make many spelling mistakes. If you see a few words being misspelled, that is a red flag that something might be up. Criminals don't have the need to try and perfect their website, and are trying to get the most gullible people, so they don't give as much focus to their website's content as long as they get money.</p>
        <h2>4. Where did you get the link from?</h2>
        <p>Often, malicious website urls are hidden in fake "password reset" emails. In the email, the url might look right (https://example.com/reset), but really takes you to (https://malicious.site.haha.evil.net). This is due to emails accepting HTML code. Be wary of urls in emails, and if possible, try to visit the website manually by searching Google, or visiting the real website directly.</p>
